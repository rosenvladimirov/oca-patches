The logic in odoo for currencies are based on the strategies applied by banks, not by the business community. It uses central exchange rate announced by the central bank of the country. The problem is that as with all other goods (money is the primary commodity) they are traded on the selling and purchase price. From this presumption made major adjustments, added buying and selling rates. Another fundamental correction is adding statistical exchange rate used for the calculation of duties and taxes on imports.
